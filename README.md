# Altman Z-Score Analysis of IPL 2025 Parent Companies

This project applies the Altman Z-Score model to assess bankruptcy risk for the parent companies of top Indian Premier League franchises: India Cements (CSK), Reliance Industries (MI), United Spirits (RCB), and Sun TV Network (SRH).

Financial data was sourced from [Moneycontrol](https://www.moneycontrol.com/) and [Screener](https://www.screener.in/), cleaned in Excel, and analyzed using Python (pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib). Results show Reliance Industries and India Cements in the distress zone, while Sun TV and United Spirits remain financially strong.
